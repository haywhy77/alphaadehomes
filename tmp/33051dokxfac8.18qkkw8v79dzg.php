                <p style="margin-top:10px;">You can think of the KNOWDEMWELL platform as a comprehensive, 
                non-partisan, and accurate information hub where you can access and understand the ideological 
                views and policies of politicians and political candidates across all tiers of government in Nigeria.
                Our researchers use data from various sources to show you the consistency or inconsistency between what
                politicians promised during their election campaigns and what they are actually doing in power,
                so that you can use that information to make better decisions during the next cycle of elections.</p>

<!--
                <p class="mt-3">We place emphasis on critical indices
                   that will establish a connection between the candidates’ past
                    (whether they have been in public office or not), and their likely
                     approach to governance if elected into office — zooming in on candidates’ 
                     ideology and reform policies, vocalized and implemented in the past and now.</p>

                    <p style="margin-top:10px;">We profile politicians and political candidates based on their commitment or lack of commitment to the following <strong>Seven Indicators:</strong></p>
                    <p style="margin-top:5px;">1. Commitment to Democracy, Human Rights, and Gender Equality</p>
                    <p>2. Commitment to Poverty Eradication</p>
                    <p>3. Commitment to Ending Corruption in Public Offices and Society</p>
                    <p>4. Commitment to Socio-Economic Development and Environmental Protection</p>
                    <p>5. Commitment to Education and Social Change</p>
                    <p>6. Commitment and Approach to Internal Security and Public Safety</p>

<p style="margin-top:10px;">WE DREAM OF a country where the government is chosen by free, fair, credible, and non-violent elections; where there is respect for the dignity and value of human life, including the absence of police brutality; where there is actual freedom of thought, religion, and conscience; where more citizens are politically active and enjoy an open civic space; where the rights and dignity of workers are preserved; where corruption in public offices and society is significantly reduced; where there is justice, rule of law, and strong and independent democratic institutions; where there is transformative governance and there is real, stable, and measurable economic growth.
